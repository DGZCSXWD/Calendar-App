# Calendar-App

This is a simple calendar app for scheduling your work day. The app is designed to allow users to input and save their tasks for each hour of the standard business day (9AM-5PM). The app also updates the background color of each time block based on whether it is in the past, present, or future, and saves the user's input in local storage so it persists even if the page is refreshed.

The current date will be displayed in the header, and you can enter tasks for each hour by clicking on the corresponding text area and typing in your task. To save a task, click on the "Save" button for the corresponding time block. The app will save your tasks in local storage so they persist even if you close the browser or refresh the page.
